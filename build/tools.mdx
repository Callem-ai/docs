# Tools

Tools extend your agent's capabilities beyond conversation. They allow the agent to perform real actions during a call — like booking appointments, looking up customer records, checking inventory, or triggering webhooks.

## How Tools Work

Tools leverage the **function calling** capability of modern LLMs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the tool">
    Create a tool with a name, description, parameters (JSON Schema), and an API endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach to an agent">
    Link the tool to one or more agents via the Model tab → Knowledge & Tools section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="LLM decides when to call">
    During a call, the LLM analyzes the conversation and determines when a tool invocation is appropriate based on its description and the caller's intent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    The system calls your API endpoint with the extracted parameters. Your endpoint processes the request and returns a result.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response integration">
    The tool's response is fed back to the LLM, which uses it to continue the conversation naturally (e.g. "I've booked your appointment for Tuesday at 3pm").
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a Tool

1. Navigate to **Build > Tools**
2. Click **New Tool**
3. Configure the tool settings (see below)

## Tool Configuration

| Field | Description | Tips |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Name** | Function name the LLM will reference | Use `snake_case` (e.g. `book_appointment`, `check_stock`). Keep it descriptive but concise. |
| **Description** | Explains when and why to use this tool | This is the most important field — the LLM reads it to decide when to invoke the tool. Be explicit about trigger conditions. |
| **Parameters** | JSON Schema defining expected inputs | Define every parameter with a type and description. Mark required fields. |
| **Endpoint URL** | HTTP endpoint called with the parameters | Must be publicly accessible. Use HTTPS for security. |
| **Method** | HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) | POST is recommended for actions, GET for lookups. |
| **Headers** | Custom headers (e.g. authorization tokens) | Include API keys or auth tokens needed by your endpoint. |

### Writing Effective Descriptions

The tool description is critical — it tells the LLM **when** to use the tool. Poor descriptions lead to missed invocations or false triggers.

**Bad description:**
> "Handles appointments"

**Good description:**
> "Book a new appointment for the caller. Use this tool ONLY when the caller has explicitly confirmed they want to schedule a visit and has provided their name, preferred date, and time. Do NOT use this tool for general questions about availability."

### Parameter Definition (JSON Schema)

Parameters use [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format. Each parameter needs:

- `type` — data type (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`)
- `description` — what this parameter represents (the LLM reads this to extract the right value from the conversation)

## Example: Appointment Booking Tool

```json
{
  "name": "book_appointment",
  "description": "Book an appointment for the caller. Use when the caller explicitly requests to schedule a visit and has provided their name, preferred date, and preferred time.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "caller_name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Full name of the caller as stated during the conversation"
      },
      "date": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Requested appointment date in YYYY-MM-DD format"
      },
      "time": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Requested appointment time in HH:MM format (24-hour)"
      },
      "reason": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Brief reason for the appointment"
      }
    },
    "required": ["caller_name", "date", "time"]
  }
}
```

## Example: CRM Lookup Tool

```json
{
  "name": "lookup_customer",
  "description": "Look up a customer record in the CRM by phone number. Use this tool at the start of the call to check if the caller is an existing customer and personalize the conversation.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "phone_number": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Caller's phone number in international format (e.g. +33612345678)"
      }
    },
    "required": ["phone_number"]
  }
}
```

## Linking Tools to an Agent

You can attach tools to agents in two ways:

1. **From the Agent's Model tab** → Knowledge & Tools section → select tools from the dropdown
2. **From the Tools page** → manage which agents use each tool

Tools can be shared across multiple agents.

## Tool Invocation During Calls

When a tool is invoked during a call, you can see it in:

- **Chat sidebar** (test mode) — shows tool name, input parameters, and output
- **Call transcript** (call detail view) — logged as part of the conversation flow
- **Observability** (if configured) — traced in Langfuse/Langsmith for debugging

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write precise, condition-specific descriptions">
    The LLM uses the tool description to decide when to call it. Include explicit trigger conditions and counter-conditions. For example: "Use when X. Do NOT use when Y."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Return human-readable responses">
    Your API endpoint should return clear messages the agent can relay to the caller. Instead of `{"status": 200, "id": "apt_123"}`, return `{"message": "Appointment confirmed for Tuesday March 15 at 3:00 PM. Confirmation number: APT-123."}`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle errors gracefully">
    Return meaningful error messages. The agent will relay these to the caller. Example: `{"error": "No available slots on that date. Please suggest an alternative."}`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One tool = one action">
    Don't create a "do everything" tool. Split complex workflows into multiple tools with clear responsibilities. The LLM handles orchestration between tools naturally.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validate inputs server-side">
    Don't trust the LLM to always extract parameters perfectly. Validate all inputs in your API endpoint and return clear error messages if something is missing or malformed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test with real scenarios">
    Call your agent and try to trigger each tool. Verify the parameters are passed correctly and the response is used appropriately in the conversation.
  </Accordion>
