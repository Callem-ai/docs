# Workflows

Workflows let you design structured, multi-step conversation flows using a visual node editor. Unlike single-prompt agents, workflows give you fine-grained control over the conversation path — including branching, conditions, and step-by-step data collection.

## When to Use Workflows

Use workflows when you need:

- **Structured conversations** with a defined sequence of questions
- **Branching logic** based on caller responses
- **Multi-step processes** like qualification surveys or intake forms
- **Complex routing** with conditional transfers or escalation paths

For simple Q&A or open-ended conversations, a single-prompt agent with a knowledge base is usually sufficient.

## Workflow Editor

The visual editor lets you build workflows by connecting **nodes** on a canvas:

### Node Types

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Start** | Entry point — configure initial greeting, language, and background sound |
| **Conversation** | A step where the agent speaks and/or listens — define prompts and expected responses |
| **Condition** | Branch the flow based on caller input or collected data |
| **Transfer** | Transfer the call to a human agent or another number |
| **End** | Terminate the call with an optional closing message |

### Start Node Properties

The Start node configures the initial behavior of the call:

- **Welcome message**: first thing the agent says
- **Language**: primary language for the call
- **Background sound**: optional ambient audio with volume control

### Connections

Nodes are connected by **edges** that define the flow. Each edge can have conditions that determine which path the conversation takes.

## Building a Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new workflow">
    Navigate to **Build > Agents**, select an agent, and switch to the **Workflow** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Start node">
    Set the welcome message, language, and any initial parameters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add conversation steps">
    Drag Conversation nodes onto the canvas. Define what the agent should say and what information to collect at each step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add branching logic">
    Use Condition nodes to route the call based on collected data (e.g. "If caller is interested, go to Step 3; otherwise, go to End").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect and save">
    Draw edges between nodes to define the flow. Click **Save** to persist the workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep workflows linear when possible">
    Complex branching is powerful but harder to debug. Start with a linear flow and add branches only where needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test every path">
    Make test calls that exercise each branch. Untested paths are where bugs hide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use clear node names">
    Name your nodes descriptively (e.g. "Collect Name", "Qualify Interest") so the workflow is readable at a glance.
