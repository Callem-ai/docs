# Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base allows you to provide your agents with domain-specific information. During a conversation, the agent automatically retrieves the most relevant content to answer caller questions accurately.

## How It Works

1. You create knowledge items containing text content
2. The content is split into chunks and embedded as vectors
3. During a call, the agent's question is matched against these vectors
4. The most relevant chunks are injected into the LLM context

This is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — it ensures your agent answers based on your data, not just general knowledge.

## Creating a Knowledge Item

1. Navigate to **Build > Knowledge Base**
2. Click **Add**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: a descriptive label (e.g. "Product Catalog Q3 2025")
   - **Description**: optional summary of the content
   - **Content**: the text your agent should know

<Tip>
  Structure your content with headings (`## Section Title`) to help the chunking algorithm split it into meaningful sections.
</Tip>

## Content Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use clear, factual language">
    Write content as you'd want the agent to say it. Avoid internal jargon unless the agent should use it with callers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Organize with headings">
    Use `## Heading` to separate topics. Each heading creates a natural chunk boundary, improving retrieval accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep items focused">
    One knowledge item per topic or document. Don't dump everything into a single item — smaller, focused items retrieve better.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update regularly">
    Outdated knowledge leads to wrong answers. Delete and recreate items when the underlying information changes.
