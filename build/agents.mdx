# Agents

Agents are the core building block of Callem Studio. An agent is an AI-powered voice assistant configured with a system prompt, a voice, a language model, and optional integrations like knowledge bases and tools.

## Creating an Agent

1. Navigate to **Build > Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Agent**
3. Give your agent a descriptive name

## Agent Configuration

Each agent is defined by an **Agent Configuration** that controls its behavior:

### System Prompt

The system prompt is the most important part of your agent. It defines the agent's personality, role, instructions, and boundaries.

<Tip>
  Write your system prompt as if you were briefing a real employee. Be specific about what the agent should do, how it should respond, and what it should avoid.
</Tip>

```text Example System Prompt
You are Sophie, a friendly receptionist at Acme Dental Clinic.
Your role is to answer incoming calls, schedule appointments, 
and answer questions about our services.

Rules:
- Always greet the caller warmly
- Ask for their name and reason for calling
- If they want an appointment, check availability
- Never provide medical advice
- If unsure, offer to transfer to the office manager
```

### Voice (TTS)

Choose a text-to-speech voice from supported providers:

| Provider | Voices | Highlights |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **ElevenLabs** | 100+ | Natural-sounding, multilingual, custom cloning |
| **Azure** | 400+ | Wide language coverage, low latency |

You can configure additional TTS settings like model selection depending on the provider.

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

Select the transcription engine for understanding caller speech:

- **Deepgram** — fast, accurate, supports multiple languages
- **Azure Speech** — enterprise-grade, wide language support

### Language Model (LLM)

Pick the underlying AI model that powers your agent's reasoning:

- GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Gemini
- And more, depending on your configuration

### Language

Set the primary language for your agent. This affects STT transcription, TTS output, and prompt behavior.

### Background Sound

Add ambient background audio to make calls feel more natural (e.g. call center ambiance). You can:

- Enable/disable the background sound
- Choose from a library of pre-configured sounds
- Adjust the volume level

### Knowledge Base

Attach one or more knowledge bases to give your agent access to domain-specific information. The agent will automatically retrieve relevant content during conversations.

### Tools

Assign tools (custom functions) that your agent can invoke during a call — like booking appointments, checking order status, or transferring the call.

## Agent Settings Summary

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Name | Display name for the agent |
| System Prompt | Instructions that define agent behavior |
| Voice | TTS voice provider and voice selection |
| STT | Speech-to-text engine |
| LLM | Language model powering responses |
| Language | Primary conversation language |
| Background Sound | Ambient audio during calls |
| Knowledge Base | Attached knowledge sources |
| Tools | Functions the agent can call |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write specific, actionable prompts">
    Vague prompts like "be helpful" lead to inconsistent behavior. Instead, describe exact scenarios: "When a caller asks about pricing, quote from the attached knowledge base."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test with real conversations">
    After configuring your agent, call the assigned phone number yourself. Listen for unnatural pauses, incorrect responses, or missed instructions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start simple, iterate">
    Begin with a minimal prompt and a single knowledge base. Add tools and complexity once the basic flow works well.
