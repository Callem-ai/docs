# Team Management

Callem Studio supports role-based access control at the project level. Invite team members, assign roles, and control who can build, deploy, or just view.

## Accessing Team Settings

Navigate to **Settings** from the sidebar (bottom section), then select the **Team** tab.

## Roles

Each team member is assigned a role that determines their permissions:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, including billing and member management. Cannot be removed. |
| **Admin** | Full control, manage members, configure all settings |
| **Developer** | Build agents, configure workflows, view analytics, run campaigns |
| **Member** | Read-only access to calls, analytics, and configurations |

## Inviting Members

1. Click **Invite Member**
2. Enter the team member's email address
3. Select a role
4. Click **Send Invitation**

The invited member will receive an email with a link to join the project. Their status shows as **Pending** until they accept.

## Managing Members

- **Change role**: click the menu icon next to a member to update their role
- **Remove**: remove a member to revoke their access to the project immediately

<Warning>
  Removing a member is immediate and cannot be undone. The member will lose access to all project resources.
</Warning>

## Multi-Project Access

A single Callem Studio account can belong to multiple projects. Each project has its own team and role assignments. Switching between projects is done via the project selector in the sidebar.
