# Campaign

Campaigns let you automate outbound calls at scale. Upload a contact list, assign an agent, set a schedule, and Callem Studio calls each contact automatically.

<Info>
  The Campaign feature is currently in early access. Core functionality (creation, scheduling, CSV upload, progress tracking) is available. Advanced features like retry logic and detailed per-contact analytics are coming soon.
