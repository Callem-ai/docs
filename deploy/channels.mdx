# Channels

Channels are the bridge between your AI agents and users. Callem Studio is **multichannel**: the same agents can handle **voice** (phone) and **chat** (web widget) conversations. Additional channels (e.g. WhatsApp, social networks) are on the roadmap.

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Voice** | Phone calls via SIP/telephony; configured with phone numbers and routing (see below). |
| **Chat** | Text conversations from the web widget or the test chat in the agent configuration; no phone number required. |

## Overview

For **Voice**, each channel typically represents a phone number or SIP endpoint linked to an agent. When a call arrives on that number, the assigned agent answers and begins the conversation. For **Chat**, the agent is exposed through the Callem Studio web interface (test chat) or an embeddable widget; the same agent configuration (workflow, tools, call analysis) powers both voice and chat.

## Voice Channel (Phone Numbers)

### Assigning an Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Channels">
    Go to **Deploy > Channels** to see all available phone numbers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a number">
    Click on the phone number you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign an agent">
    Choose the agent (single-prompt or workflow) that should handle calls on this number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save the configuration. Incoming calls to this number will now be handled by the assigned agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Inbound calls** | Receive calls — the assigned agent answers automatically with the configured welcome message |
| **Outbound calls** | Place calls using this number as the caller ID (used by campaigns) |

<Info>
  SIP trunking and number porting are on the roadmap. Contact **contact@callem.ai** if you need custom telephony integration.
</Info>

### Multi-Number Setup

You can assign the same agent to multiple numbers, or different agents to different numbers:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Language routing** | French number → French agent, English number → English agent |
| **Department routing** | Sales number → Sales agent, Support number → Support agent |
| **Geographic routing** | Regional numbers → location-specific agents |
| **Overflow** | Primary + backup number → same agent for high availability |

## Chat Channel

The **Chat** channel lets users talk to your agent via text in a browser. No phone number is required.

### Where Chat Is Available

| Context | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Test chat (Callem Studio)** | In **Build > Agents**, open an agent and use the **Test Chat** sidebar to run a conversation. Useful for development and QA. |
| **Web widget** | Embed the chat widget on your website or app; it connects to the same Voice Gateway chatbot service and uses the same agent (workflow, tools, knowledge base, call analysis). |

### Same Agent, Same Features

The same agent configuration powers both voice and chat: system prompt, workflow, tools, knowledge base, end-call and transfer tools, and **call analysis**. At the end of a chat session, call analysis runs on the message history (if configured) and the result is stored on the chat record, so you can filter and analyze chat sessions in **Monitor > Analytics** and **Monitor > Calls** (Chats tab) the same way as voice calls.

### Configuration

Chat uses the **Voice Gateway** chatbot service. Ensure the agent’s workflow and model are correctly set; the dashboard frontend connects to the chatbot via the configured socket URL (e.g. `VITE_SOCKET_HOST` in your environment). No per-channel assignment is needed for chat — each agent is available for chat from the moment it is configured.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test before going live">
    Always call your configured number from a personal phone to verify the agent responds correctly before publishing the number publicly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor call quality after deployment">
    After deployment, check **Monitor > Calls** regularly for dropped calls, poor transcription, or unexpected agent behavior.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use dedicated numbers per use case">
    Separating sales from support at the phone number level makes analytics cleaner and allows you to assign specialized agents to each function.
