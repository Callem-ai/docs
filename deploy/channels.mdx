# Channels

Channels are the bridge between your AI agents and the real world. Configure phone numbers, SIP trunks, and routing rules to handle inbound and outbound calls.

## Overview

Each channel represents a phone number or SIP endpoint linked to an agent. When a call arrives on that number, the assigned agent picks up and begins the conversation automatically.

## Phone Number Configuration

### Assigning an Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Channels">
    Go to **Deploy > Channels** to see all available phone numbers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a number">
    Click on the phone number you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign an agent">
    Choose the agent (single-prompt or workflow) that should handle calls on this number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save the configuration. Incoming calls to this number will now be handled by the assigned agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Inbound calls** | Receive calls — the assigned agent answers automatically with the configured welcome message |
| **Outbound calls** | Place calls using this number as the caller ID (used by campaigns) |

<Info>
  SIP trunking and number porting are on the roadmap. Contact **contact@callem.ai** if you need custom telephony integration.

## Multi-Number Setup

You can assign the same agent to multiple numbers, or different agents to different numbers:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Language routing** | French number → French agent, English number → English agent |
| **Department routing** | Sales number → Sales agent, Support number → Support agent |
| **Geographic routing** | Regional numbers → location-specific agents |
| **Overflow** | Primary + backup number → same agent for high availability |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test before going live">
    Always call your configured number from a personal phone to verify the agent responds correctly before publishing the number publicly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor call quality after deployment">
    After deployment, check **Monitor > Calls** regularly for dropped calls, poor transcription, or unexpected agent behavior.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use dedicated numbers per use case">
    Separating sales from support at the phone number level makes analytics cleaner and allows you to assign specialized agents to each function.
