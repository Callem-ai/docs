# Channels

Channels are the bridge between your AI agents and the real world. Configure phone numbers, SIP trunks, and routing rules to handle inbound and outbound calls.

## Overview

Each channel represents a phone number or SIP endpoint linked to an agent. When a call arrives on that number, the assigned agent picks up and begins the conversation.

## Phone Number Configuration

### Assigning an Agent

1. Navigate to **Deploy > Channels**
2. Select a phone number from the list
3. Choose the agent that should handle calls on this number
4. Save the configuration

### Supported Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Inbound calls** | Receive calls — the assigned agent answers automatically |
| **Outbound calls** | Place calls using this number as the caller ID |
| **SIP trunking** | Connect your existing telephony infrastructure via SIP |
| **Number import** | Bring your own phone number from another provider |

## SIP Configuration

For enterprises with existing telephony setups, Callem Studio supports SIP trunk integration:

- **SIP URI**: your Callem SIP endpoint for routing
- **Authentication**: credentials or IP-based allowlisting
- **Codec support**: G.711 (PCMU/PCMA), Opus

<Info>
  Contact support at **contact@callem.ai** for assistance with custom SIP configurations.

## Multi-Number Setup

You can assign the same agent to multiple numbers, or different agents to different numbers. This allows scenarios like:

- **Language routing**: French number → French agent, English number → English agent
- **Department routing**: Sales number → Sales agent, Support number → Support agent
- **Geographic routing**: different numbers for different regions, all handled by specialized agents

## Best Practices

    Always call your configured number from a personal phone to verify the agent responds correctly before publishing the number publicly.

  <Accordion title="Monitor call quality">
    After deployment, check the **Monitor > Calls** section regularly for dropped calls, poor transcription, or unexpected agent behavior.
