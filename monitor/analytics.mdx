# Analytics

The Analytics dashboard gives you a bird's-eye view of your voice AI operations. Track key performance indicators, identify trends, and build custom charts to monitor what matters most to your business.

## Built-in Metrics

Callem Studio tracks the following metrics out of the box:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total calls** | Number of calls in the selected period |
| **Average duration** | Mean call length in seconds |
| **Engagement rate** | Percentage of calls that were engaged (meaningful conversations) |
| **Automation rate** | Percentage of calls fully handled by the AI (no transfer) |
| **Transfer rate** | Percentage of calls transferred to a human |

## Dashboard Features

### Date Range Selection

Select the time period to analyze — from the last 24 hours to custom date ranges. All charts and metrics update dynamically.

### Agent Filtering

Filter analytics by specific agents to compare performance across different use cases or teams.

### Custom Dashboards

Create custom dashboard views with the charts and metrics most relevant to your operations:

1. Click **New Dashboard**
2. Add chart widgets
3. Configure each chart with the metric, aggregation, and visualization type
4. Save and name your dashboard

### Custom Charts

Build charts based on any metric, including call analysis fields:

- **Line charts** — track trends over time
- **Bar charts** — compare values across categories
- **Counters** — display a single KPI prominently

You can chart both built-in fields (duration, engagement) and custom call analysis fields (sentiment, lead quality, etc.).
