# Analytics

The Analytics dashboard gives you a comprehensive view of your voice and chat AI operations. Track KPIs, identify trends, and build custom charts to monitor what matters most to your business.

## Multichannel Support

Analytics aggregates data from **multiple channels**. Today the platform supports:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Voice** | Phone calls handled by the voice gateway (SIP / telephony) |
| **Chat** | Text conversations from the web widget or test chat in Callem Studio |

You can view metrics for **Voice only**, **Chat only**, or **both** (combined). The channel selector is a multi-select dropdown at the top of the page. Labels and KPIs adapt: for example, "Total Calls" becomes "Total Chats" when only Chat is selected, or "Total Conversations" when both channels are selected. Additional channels (e.g. WhatsApp and social networks) are planned; the filter is designed to scale as new channels are added.

<Info>
  Latency KPIs (LLM / TTS / Global) are primarily relevant for Voice; chat sessions may show zero or partial TTS latency. Engagement, transfer rate, duration, and call analysis apply to both channels where applicable.
</Info>

## Filters

All analytics data is filtered by the controls at the top of the page:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Date range** | Select the time period to analyze |
| **Duration** | Filter by conversation duration range (min/max in seconds) |
| **Agent** | Multi-select to filter by specific agents |
| **Channel** | Multi-select: Voice and Chat (or both). Future channels will appear here. |
| **Call Analysis** | Filter by custom analysis field values (e.g. `sentiment = positive`) |

All KPIs and charts update dynamically when filters change.

## Overview Dashboard

The built-in overview dashboard provides two rows of KPI cards and six default charts.

### KPI Cards — Row 1 (Volume & Engagement)

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Total Calls / Chats / Conversations** | Total number of voice calls, chat sessions, or both (depending on channel filter) in the selected period |
| **Engagement Rate** | Percentage of calls that were engaged (meaningful conversations vs. hang-ups, voicemails). Subtitle shows the raw engaged count. |
| **Transfer Rate** | Percentage of calls transferred to a human agent. Subtitle shows the raw transfer count. |
| **Reiteration Rate** | Rate of callers who called back multiple times |
| **Peak Simultaneous** | Maximum number of concurrent calls at any point during the period |

### KPI Cards — Row 2 (Performance & Latency)

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **AHT** | Average Handle Time — mean duration of engaged calls, in seconds |
| **Interactions / Call** | Average number of back-and-forth exchanges per call |
| **LLM Latency** | Average time (ms) for the LLM to generate a response |
| **TTS Latency** | Average time (ms) for the text-to-speech engine to produce audio |
| **Global Latency** | Average end-to-end latency (ms) from caller speech to agent response |

<Tip>
  LLM and TTS latency are critical metrics for call quality. If Global Latency exceeds 1500ms, callers may perceive the agent as slow or unresponsive. Consider using a faster LLM model or a lower-latency TTS provider.
</Tip>

### Default Charts

| Chart | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Call / Conversation Volume** | Area/Bar | Total calls or chats per time interval (auto-adjusts granularity based on date range) |
| **Concurrency** | Line | Simultaneous active calls/chats per minute/hour throughout the day |
| **Hourly Distribution** | Bar | Call distribution across 24 hours — identify peak hours |
| **Day of Week Distribution** | Bar | Call distribution across 7 days — identify peak days |
| **KPI Evolution** | Multi-line | Engagement rate / Transfer rate / AHT trends over time |
| **Latency Evolution** | Multi-line | LLM / TTS / Global latency trends over time |

### Per-Agent Table

A sortable table comparing agents side by side:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent** | Agent name |
| **Calls** | Total call count |
| **Volume** | Visual bar showing relative volume |
| **Engagement** | Engagement rate percentage |
| **AHT** | Average handle time |

## Custom Dashboards

In addition to the built-in Overview tab, you can create unlimited custom dashboard tabs.

### Managing Dashboard Tabs

- **Create**: click the **+** button next to existing tabs
- **Rename**: right-click a tab or use the dropdown menu
- **Reorder**: drag and drop tabs to rearrange
- **Duplicate**: create a copy of an existing dashboard
- **Delete**: remove a dashboard (the Overview tab cannot be deleted)

### Adding Charts

Each custom dashboard contains a grid of charts that you configure:

1. Enter **Edit Mode** by clicking the edit icon on a dashboard tab
2. Click **Add Chart** to open the chart editor
3. Configure the chart (see below)
4. Save — the chart appears in the dashboard grid

### Chart Sizes

Charts can be resized in the grid:

| Size | Grid Width | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Small** | 1/3 width | Single KPI numbers, small donuts |
| **Medium** | 2/3 width | Standard charts |
| **Large** | Full width | Detailed time series, complex visualizations |

Charts can be reordered via **drag and drop** in edit mode.

## Chart Editor

The chart editor is where you configure what data to visualize and how.

### Chart Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Column** | Vertical bar chart | Comparing categories, time series |
| **Bar** | Horizontal bar chart | Ranking comparisons |
| **Line** | Line chart | Trends over time |
| **Donut** | Pie chart with center hole | Distribution / proportions |
| **Number** | Single large value | Highlighting one KPI |

### Metrics

#### Built-in Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Call Counts** | Total number of calls |
| **Average Call Duration** | Mean call duration in seconds |
| **Engagement Rate** | % of engaged calls |
| **Transfer Rate** | % of transferred calls |
| **Voicemail Rate** | % of calls reaching voicemail |
| **LLM Latency** | Average LLM response time (ms) |
| **TTS Latency** | Average TTS generation time (ms) |
| **Global Latency** | Average end-to-end latency (ms) |
| **Interactions / Call** | Average exchanges per call |

#### Custom Analysis Metrics

If you've configured [call analysis fields](/build/agents#call-analysis-tab) on your agents, they appear automatically as available metrics. For example, if you have a `sentiment` field with values `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`, you can create a donut chart showing sentiment distribution.

#### Custom Rate Metric

Create calculated percentage metrics by defining a numerator and denominator:

- **Rate conditions** (numerator): filters that define the "success" subset
- **Base filters** (denominator): filters that define the total population
- **Logic**: combine multiple conditions with AND or OR

**Example**: "Hot lead rate among engaged calls"
- Numerator: `callAnalysis.leadQuality = hot`
- Denominator: `isEngaged = true`
- Result: percentage displayed as a chart

### Chart Filters

Each chart can have its own independent filters (in addition to the global page filters):

| Filter Category | Fields |
|----------------|--------|
| **Call fields** | Duration / isEngaged / endedReason / callerNum / calledNum / totalInteraction |
| **Agent** | Filter by specific agent(s) |
| **Call Analysis** | Any custom analysis field defined on your agents |

#### Filter Operators

Operators vary by field type:

| Field Type | Available Operators |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Number** | equals / not equals / greater than / greater-or-equal / less than / less-or-equal / Exists |
| **Boolean** | equals / Exists |
| **String** | Equals / Not equals / Contains / Exists |
| **Selector** | Equals / Not equals / Exists |

Multiple filters can be combined with **AND** or **OR** logic.

### Time Granularity

For time-series charts (Column / Line / Bar), choose the aggregation granularity:

| Granularity | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|
| **Hour** | Short date ranges (1-3 days) |
| **Day** | Medium ranges (1 week to 1 month) |
| **Week** | Long ranges (1-6 months) |
| **Month** | Very long ranges (6+ months) |

### Live Preview

The chart editor shows a live preview that updates as you change settings, so you can verify the visualization before saving.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with the Overview dashboard">
    The built-in KPIs and charts cover the most common monitoring needs. Get familiar with them before creating custom dashboards.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create role-specific dashboards">
    Build separate dashboards for different stakeholders: an operations dashboard with volume and latency metrics, a sales dashboard with lead quality and booking rates, a quality dashboard with sentiment and resolution tracking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use custom rates for business KPIs">
    The custom rate metric lets you calculate any business-specific percentage (e.g. "appointment booking rate among interested callers") directly in the dashboard without external tooling.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine chart filters with global filters">
    Global filters (date, agent, channel) apply to all charts. Use per-chart filters for specific slices — e.g. a chart showing only calls where `endedReason = transfer`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use the channel filter for channel-specific views">
    To compare or isolate performance by channel, use the **Channel** filter: select **Voice** for phone metrics and **Chat** for web widget metrics, or both for combined conversation metrics. Custom dashboard charts respect the same channel selection.
