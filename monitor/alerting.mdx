# Alerting

Alerting lets you define rules that automatically monitor your call metrics and notify you when something goes wrong — or right. Get alerted when call volume drops, latency spikes, or custom business metrics cross thresholds, without staring at dashboards all day.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define a rule">
    Create an alert rule with a metric, threshold, agents to monitor, and evaluation parameters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic evaluation">
    Callem Studio evaluates the rule at your configured frequency (every minute to once a day).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incident creation">
    When the threshold is crossed, an incident is created and email notifications are sent to the configured recipients.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-resolution">
    When the metric returns to normal, the incident is automatically resolved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating an Alert Rule

Navigate to **Monitor > Alerting** and click **Create Rule**.

### Rule Configuration

| Field | Description | Options |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Descriptive name for the alert | e.g. "Low engagement rate", "High latency warning" |
| **Metric** | What to measure | Total calls, Avg duration, Engagement rate, Transfer rate, Voicemail rate, LLM latency, TTS latency, Global latency, or a **Custom rate** |
| **Agents** | Which agents to monitor | Select one, multiple, or all agents. Use Select All / Deselect All for convenience. |

### Threshold Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Threshold type** | **Absolute** — compare the metric value directly to a fixed number (e.g. engagement rate < 50%). **Relative** — compare the current value to the previous period's value (e.g. call volume dropped by 30% compared to yesterday). |
| **Comparator** | `>` Greater than, `>=` Greater or equal, `<` Less than, `<=` Less or equal |
| **Threshold value** | The value that triggers the alert. For absolute, this is the raw metric value. For relative, this is the percentage change. |

### Evaluation Parameters

| Setting | Description | Values |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Evaluation window** | How far back to look when computing the metric | 1 minute to 12 hours |
| **Frequency** | How often to evaluate the rule | 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day |
| **Notification emails** | Comma-separated list of email addresses to notify | — |

## Custom Rate Metrics

Beyond built-in metrics, you can define alerts on **calculated percentages** by specifying numerator and denominator filters:

### How Custom Rates Work

A custom rate is calculated as:

$$\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Calls matching numerator conditions}}{\text{Calls matching denominator conditions}} \times 100$$

### Examples

| Alert | Numerator | Denominator | Threshold |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Hot lead rate too low | `callAnalysis.leadQuality = hot` | `isEngaged = true` | `< 20%` |
| Appointment booking rate | `callAnalysis.appointmentBooked = true` | All calls | `< 15%` |
| Negative sentiment spike | `callAnalysis.sentiment = negative` | `isEngaged = true` | `> 25%` |
| Automated call success | `callAnalysis.issueResolved = true` | `endedReason != voicemail` | `< 70%` |

### Condition Logic

Both numerator and denominator support multiple conditions combined with **AND** or **OR** logic.

## Call Analysis Filters

Add conditions based on your custom [call analysis fields](/build/agents#call-analysis-tab) to create highly targeted alerts. The available fields are loaded dynamically from your agent configurations.

**Built-in filter fields:**
- `duration`, `isEngaged`, `endedReason`, `callerNum`, `calledNum`, `totalInteraction`

**Call Analysis filter fields** (from your agent config):
- Any field you've defined (e.g. `sentiment`, `leadQuality`, `appointmentBooked`, `npsScore`)

These fields appear in a separate "Call Analysis" section in the filter UI.

## Evaluation Schedule

By default, alerts evaluate **24/7**. You can restrict evaluation to specific windows to prevent false alarms during off-hours:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Days** | Select which days of the week (e.g. Monday to Friday) |
| **Time ranges** | One or more time windows (e.g. 9:00-13:00 and 14:00-20:00) |
| **Hourly frequency** | Evaluate once per hour instead of continuous |

**Example**: "Only evaluate this alert Monday to Friday, 9:00-13:00 and 14:00-18:00" — avoids alerts during nights, lunch breaks, and weekends when low volume is expected.

<Tip>
  Scheduling is particularly useful for volume-based alerts. A "total calls < 10" alert would fire every night if evaluated 24/7, but is meaningful only during business hours.
</Tip>

## Alert States

| State | Description | Visual |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **OK** | Metric is within normal range | Green indicator |
| **Firing** | Threshold has been crossed — incident created, notifications sent | Red indicator |
| **Resolved** | Metric returned to normal — incident closed automatically | Returns to green |

---

## Alert Rules List

The alert rules list provides an at-a-glance view of all your rules:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Alert rule name |
| **Status** | Enabled/disabled toggle |
| **State** | Current state (OK / Firing) |
| **Last metric value** | The most recently measured value — useful for verifying that the alert definition is correct and the evaluation is working |
| **Last evaluated** | When the rule was last checked |
| **Badges** | Indicators for Custom Rate, Scheduled, etc. |

<Tip>
  Use **Last metric value** and **Last evaluated** to verify your alert rules are working correctly. If the value seems wrong, review your metric definition and filters.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with broad, high-impact alerts">
    Begin with alerts on critical metrics: total call volume (is the system working?), engagement rate (are calls successful?), and global latency (is the agent responsive?). Add specific custom rate alerts once the basics are covered.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set thresholds from historical data">
    Look at your analytics dashboard to understand normal metric ranges before setting thresholds. A threshold that's too tight creates alert fatigue; too loose misses real issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use schedules to reduce noise">
    If your agents only handle calls during business hours, schedule volume and rate alerts accordingly. Latency alerts can often run 24/7 since they indicate system health.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine built-in and custom rate alerts">
    Built-in metrics catch infrastructure issues (latency, volume drops). Custom rates catch business quality issues (lead quality, appointment rates, sentiment).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review and tune regularly">
    As your call patterns change (seasonal volume, new agents, new prompts), revisit your alert thresholds and schedules to keep them relevant.
