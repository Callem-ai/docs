# Calls

The Calls section is your central hub for reviewing every conversation your agents have handled. Browse call history, read transcripts, listen to recordings, and inspect call analysis data.

## Call List

Navigate to **Monitor > Calls** to see a paginated list of all calls. Each row shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Caller** | Phone number of the caller |
| **Agent** | Which agent handled the call |
| **Duration** | Length of the call |
| **Status** | `completed` or `live` |
| **Engaged** | Whether the call was a meaningful conversation (vs. voicemail, hang-up) |
| **Date** | When the call occurred |

### Filtering

Use the filter bar to narrow results by:

- **Date range** — find calls from a specific period
- **Agent** — filter by one or more agents
- **Duration** — minimum/maximum call length
- **Call analysis fields** — filter by custom analysis values (e.g. sentiment, lead quality)

## Call Detail

Click on any call to see the full detail view:

### Transcript

The complete conversation transcript, showing each message with its role:
- **User** — what the caller said
- **Assistant** — what the agent said

### Recording

Listen to the full audio recording of the call directly in the browser.

### Call Analysis

If call analysis is configured for the agent, you'll see extracted data like:

- **Summary** — AI-generated summary of the conversation
- **Evaluation** — success/failure assessment
- **Custom fields** — any fields you've defined (e.g. `sentiment`, `leadQuality`, `appointmentBooked`)

### Metadata

Additional call metadata:

- **Ended reason** — why the call ended (user hang-up, agent hang-up, transfer, error)
- **Caller/Called numbers** — full phone numbers
- **Total interactions** — number of back-and-forth exchanges

## Live Calls

Calls currently in progress appear with a `live` badge. The live call counter in the header shows how many calls are active across all agents.

## API Access

Call data is also available through the [Public API](/api-reference/calls/list-calls) for integration with external systems.
