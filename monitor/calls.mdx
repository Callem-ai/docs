# Calls

The Calls section is your central hub for reviewing every conversation your agents have handled. Browse call history, read transcripts, listen to recordings, and inspect call analysis data.

## Call List

Navigate to **Monitor > Calls** to see a paginated list of all calls.

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Caller** | Phone number of the caller |
| **Agent** | Which agent handled the call |
| **Duration** | Length of the call in seconds |
| **Status** | `completed` or `live` |
| **Engaged** | Whether the call was a meaningful conversation (vs. voicemail, hang-up, short interaction) |
| **Ended Reason** | Why the call ended (user hang-up, agent hang-up, transfer, error, etc.) |
| **Call Analysis** | Extracted analysis values (if configured on the agent) |
| **Date** | When the call occurred |

### Filters

The filter bar lets you narrow results using multiple criteria simultaneously:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Date range** | Start and end date/time picker |
| **Duration** | Minimum and maximum call duration slider (in seconds) |
| **Agent** | Multi-select dropdown to filter by one or more agents |
| **Search** | Free-text search across caller number and transcription content |
| **Call Analysis** | Dynamic filters based on your agent's call analysis fields (e.g. `sentiment = positive`, `leadQuality = hot`). Fields and available values are loaded automatically from your agent configurations. |

### Live vs. History Mode

Toggle between two modes using the **Live / History** switch:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **History** | Paginated server-side data with full filtering. Load more results or adjust page size (default: 20). |
| **Live** | Real-time view of active calls via WebSocket. Shows calls currently in progress with a live badge. Filters are applied client-side. |

## Call Detail

Click any call to open the detail drawer:

### Transcript

The complete conversation transcript showing each exchange:
- **User** — what the caller said (transcribed from audio)
- **Assistant** — what the agent said (generated by the LLM and spoken via TTS)

### Recording

Play the full audio recording of the call directly in the browser with playback controls.

### Call Analysis

If [call analysis](/build/agents#call-analysis-tab) is configured for the agent, you'll see extracted structured data:

- **Text fields** — free-form extracted information (e.g. summary, key points)
- **Selector fields** — categorized values (e.g. sentiment: positive, lead quality: hot)
- **Number fields** — numeric values (e.g. satisfaction score: 4.5)
- **Boolean fields** — yes/no determinations (e.g. appointment booked: true)
